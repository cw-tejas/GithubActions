A simple, modern counter application built with React and Vite. This app demonstrates basic React concepts including state management, event handling, and component composition.

## Features

- âž• Increment counter
- âž– Decrement counter
- ðŸ”„ Reset counter to zero
- ðŸ“± Responsive design
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern gradient UI with smooth animations
- âš¡ Fast development with Vite HMR

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test:run

# Run tests in watch mode (recommended for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with UI interface
npm run test:ui
```

The project includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function testing
- **Integration Tests**: User workflow and accessibility testing
- **Performance Tests**: Render speed and memory usage validation
- **100% Test Coverage**: All functionality is thoroughly tested

See [TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md](./TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed testing information.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for automated testing and deployment:

### ðŸ¤– Automated Workflow

- **Pull Request Testing**: All PRs to `main` branch automatically run the full test suite
- **Manual Merge Control**: Comment `:runMerge` to trigger merge with unit tests
- **Merge Blocking**: PRs with failing tests cannot be merged
- **Real-time Feedback**: Detailed test results and coverage reports posted as PR comments

### âš¡ Quick Start for Contributors

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make changes and add tests
4. Push and create a pull request
5. Watch automated tests run and receive feedback
6. Comment `:runMerge` to merge when tests pass! ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸ“Š What Gets Tested

- ESLint code quality checks
- 35+ comprehensive unit tests
- Integration and performance tests
- Production build validation
- Test coverage reporting

See [GITHUB_ACTIONS_DOCS.md](./GITHUB_ACTIONS_DOCS.md) for complete CI/CD documentation.
